We first met Virgil Tibbs in "In the Heat of the Night," when he was acop from Philadelphia. In "They Call Me Mister Tibbs," he moved to San Francisco and had a really elaborate hilltop home. Now, in "TheOrganization," he has moved into a less elaborate home (apparentlyafter reading the reviews wondering how he could meet the payments on his police salary), but he still has his loving wife, sweet daughter and smart-mouth son. There is just barely a chance for each family member to do his thing, however, because Tibbs is up to here in the most complicated caper of his career. It is so complicated, in fact, that I am not sure I could figure it out. Maybe we're supposed to take things in the spirit of "The Big Sleep" (1946) which didn't bother to tie up several very loose ends. Advertisement The plot is not exactly believable. It's about a strange gang ofcharacters (a storefront preacher, a member of a girl's track team,etc.) who steal an enormous shipment of heroin. But after they maketheir getaway, someone else kills the guy they left behind, bound andgagged. They let Tibbs in on their secret because they don't want themurder rap (although since they DID kidnap the guy and nothing canbring him back to life, you'd think they would keep quiet). Anyway, after an investigation that gets a little confused, Tibbs issuspended from the force for concealing his knowledge. And then he is either put back on the force (in a scene not in the picture) and is on plainclothes duty in the unfinished subway system, or he was not cleared and just happens to be working on the subway when the movie's big chase scene goes by. Anyway, there's a bit of shooting, a few identities are untangled, and the movie comes to an unmourned end.
