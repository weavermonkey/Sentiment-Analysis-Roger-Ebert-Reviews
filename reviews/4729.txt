Hello muddah,Hello fadduh--Here I am at "Wet Hot American Summah." Wow I hate itSomething fierce--Except the astrophysicistDavid Hyde Pierce. He lives in aCottage nearbyAnd boy can he make Jeanane Garofolo sigh. She's the directorOf Camp Firewood,Which turns before our eyes into Camp Feelgood. She is funnyAs she's hurryingThrough the camper's names, including David Ben Gurion. She dreams of bunkingDavid Hyde Pierce,Who fears a falling Skylab will crush them first. (Chorus)Let me leave,Oh mudduh faddah--From this comic romp in Mother Nature...Don't make me stay,Oh mudduh faddah--In this idiotic motion picture. Advertisement Every camperAnd each counselorIs horny, especiallyMichael Showalter. He lusts afterMarguerite Moreau's bod,But she prefers the lifeguard played byPaul Rudd. The camp cook,Chris Meloni,Goes berserk because he feels attacked by phonies. He talks to bean cansAnd screams and moansPeriodically because of Post-Traumatic Anxiety Syndrome. (Chorus)I want to escape,Oh mudduh faddah--Life's too short for cinematic torture.Comedies like this,Oh mudduh faddah--Inspire in me the critic as a vulture. Ben and McKinleyAchieve their fameAs campers whose love dare not speak its name.Ken MarinoDoesn't go raftingPreferingMarisa Ryan, who is zaftig. Watch David Wain'sDirection falter,Despite the help of co-writer Showalter. They did The State,On MTV,And of the two that is the one you should see. Thoughts of "Meatballs"Cruelly hamperAttempts by us to watch as happy campers. Allan ShermanSang on the telly.I stole from him, and he from Ponchielli.
