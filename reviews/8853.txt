The southern-based playwright and screenwriter Angus Maclachlan makes his filmdirectorial debut with this disarming sex comedy about a fellow named Otto whosehapless inattention to certain salient details of his existence leads to the breakup of hismarriage. Otto, played with sly charm and vulnerability by     Paul Schneider    , is so in themoment that he tends to discount how a given moment might do some damage, as whenhe crushes his foot tooling around in a dune buggy with his nine-year-old daughter.Later on, that daughter, Edie (     Audrey P. Scott    , who’s wonderful), tells her mom Annie(     Melanie Lynskey    ), how she’s been praying for her dad, because she “wants God to benice to him.”Advertisement Annie doesn’t feel like being super-nice to him; soon, with the help of a very take-chargetherapist, Annie informs Otto that “the marriage is over” and Otto is soon out on his own.Upon learning of the affair that prompted Annie’s action, Otto returns to the dating pooland is both bemused and frustrated to learn that love interests both old and new, playedby an array of attractive actresses that go from     Heather Graham    to     Anna Camp    to AshleyHinshaw to     Heather Lawless    , are largely interested in falling into bed with him and notmuch else.There’s a lot of good awkward fun to be had as the viewer simultaneously laughsat Otto’s expense and hopefully commiserates a bit with him. Particularly hilariousand cringeworthy is a scene of a nude sit between Otto and young, lissome Mildred(Hinshaw), who’s very into chat prior to sexual activity. “I like that you have calluses onthe palms of your hands,” Mildred coos to Otto, and the look on Schneider’s face as heregards his distinctly un-callused palms (the guy works as a web designer, for heaven’ssake) is priceless. The movie is replete with little eccentric touches of behavior, dialogueand performance. It’s in a totally different register than the two prior Maclachlanpictures I’ve seen, the affectionate and quirky Southern family drama “     Junebug    ” (2005,directed by     Phil Morrison    ) and the intense spiritual allegory “     Stone    ” (2010, directedby     John Curran    ). There’s almost a sense of male wish-fulfillment in the parade of trulyluminous women who come into Otto’s life, but this makes the humor of their subsequenteccentricities that much more potent, as in Camp’s sexual super-freak who, after anintense bout with both Otto and a sex toy quietly avers “I wanna read my Bible.”Ottoand Maclachlan seem to embody the same attitude towards women: affection and nearlyawe-filled respect combined with a certain amused exasperation. It’s slightly ironic thatby then end of this concise film’s story arc, the most ostensibly sane of Otto’s romancesmakes him the most outlandish proposition, to which Otto replies: “Can I?” Whether hecan and whether he does is addressed in the movie’s coda, and movie lovers looking foran unusual, quirky, regionally sensitive (autumn in North Carolina has never looked moreappealing in a film) will enjoy taking the brisk, entertaining journey to the place of Otto’sresolution.Advertisement
