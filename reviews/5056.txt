One of the many miracles of "The Life and Death of ColonelBlimp" is the way the movie transforms a blustering, pigheaded caricatureinto one of the most loved of all movie characters. Colonel Blimp began life ina series of famous British cartoons by David Low, who represented him as anoverstuffed blowhard. The movie looks past the fat, bald military man with thewalrus moustache, and sees inside, to an idealist and a romantic. To know himis to love him. Made in 1942 at the height of the Nazi threat to Great Britain,Michael Powelland Emeric Pressburger's work is an uncommonly civilized filmabout war and soldiers--and rarer still, a film that defends the old againstthe young. Its hero is a blustering old windbag Clive Wynne-Candy, a war-horseof the Army since the Boer War, now twice retired from regular duty andrelegated to leading the Home Guard. Advertisement Asthe film opens, the general has ordered military training exercises andannounced, "War starts at midnight." A gung-ho young lieutenantdecides that modern warfare doesn't play by the rules, and jumps the gun,leading his men into the General's London club and arresting him in the steamroom. When Wynne-Candy bellows, "You bloody young fool--war starts atmidnight!" the lieutenant observes that the Nazis do not observegentleman's agreements, and insults the old man's belly and mustache. Wynne-Candyis outraged. "You laugh at my big belly but you don't know how I got it!You laugh at my mustache but you don't know why I grew it!" He punches theyoung lieutenant, wrestles him into a swimming pool--and then, in a flashbackof grace and wit, the camera pans along the surface of the water until, at theother end, young Clive Candy emerges. He is thin and without a mustache, and itis 1902. "TheLife and Death of Colonel Blimp" has four story threads. It mourns thepassing of a time when professional soldiers observed a code of honor. Itargues to the young that the old were young once, too, and contain within themall that the young know, and more. It marks the General's lonely romanticpassage through life, in which he seeks the double of the first woman he loved.And it records a friendship between a British officer and a German officer,which spans the crucial years from 1902 to 1942. Thisis an audacious enough story idea to begin with, but even more daring in 1942,when London was bombed nightly and the Nazis seemed to be winning the war.Powell at first wantedLaurence Olivierto play his title role, but thescreenplay ran into fierce opposition from Winston Churchill, and the Ministryof War refused to release Olivier from military duty. Then Powell cast RogerLivesay, a young actor who had worked for him before, and as the Germanofficer, an emigre Austrian actor namedAnton Walbrook. Advertisement Thatled to an encounter between Churchill and Walbrook, recounted by the Britishfilm critic Derek Malcolm: "Churchill's reaction was furious. He is saidto have stormed into Walbrook's dressing room when he was appearing in a WestEnd play demanding: 'What's this film supposed to mean? I suppose you regard itas good propaganda for Britain.' Anton's reply was quite telling, he said 'Nopeople in the world other than the English would have had the courage, in themidst of war, to tell the people such unvarnished truth'." Ah,but he praised his adopted homeland too soon. Churchill continued to resist.Powell could not borrow gear and trucks from the Army, "so we stolethem." The film was at first banned, then reluctantly released in ashorter version, and in the U.S. it lost 50 minutes of its 163-minute runningtime; the entire flashback structure was replaced by a chronological storyline. Only in 1983 was the film finally restored, and hailed as a masterpiece."It stands," wrote the critic Dave Kehr, "as very possibly thefinest film ever made in Britain." "TheLife and Death of Colonel Blimp" is a film of balance and insight--acivilized film, which even in a time of war celebrates civilized values. Whatit regrets is the loss, in two World Wars, of a sense of decency and fair playthat had governed the European military classes. Near the film's end, theGerman refugee corrects the sentimentalism of the old general, telling him fromfirst-hand experience that Nazism is the greatest evil the world has everknown, and saying there is no point in playing fair when the enemy plays foul,if that means you lose, and evil wins. Advertisement Despitethis sober undercurrent, "Colonel Blimp" is above all a comedy ofmanners, and Powell and his writing and producing partner Pressburger conductit with style and humor. Jolly music underlines an opening sequence in whichmotorcycle messengers distribute news of the war games, and there is wit in themovie's ingenious flashbacks and flash-forwards. Photographed by GeorgesPerinal with help fromJack Cardiff, the movie is one of the best-lookingTechnicolor productions ever made, its palate controlled to make wise use ofbright contrasts in a world of subdued harmony. Severalscenes surprise us by how they pay off. Note the early duel between the Britishand German officers (they do not even know one another; the German was drawn bylot to respond to an insult to the German army). A high-angle shot refuses totake sides, the Swedish referee scuttles back and forth like a crab--and then,just when we expect to see the outcome, the camera cranes up to an exteriorshot of the Army gymnasium (a model), with snow falling on Berlin. The messageis made visually: The season of traditional values is ending, and thesesoldiers will not again play so fair. Inhospital, Clive Candy and his opponent, Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff, are visitedby Candy's British friend, Edith Hunter (Deborah Kerr). The German falls inlove with her and proposes marriage. Candy is at first delighted, but as hereturns home he realizes he loved her, too, and begins a lifelong search for asubstitute. Fifteen years later, in a World War One hospital, he sees a youngnurse who is Edith's spitting image, and arranges a dance for war nurses justto meet her again. This is Barbara Wynne, again played by Deborah Kerr. Notethe dinner scene when Candy explains his motive for seeking her out, and thesubtle chill with which Barbara says she quite understands. The marriage fadesout like the duel did, as if there is nothing else worth saying. Advertisement Kerrappears a third time as a working-class girl named Angela Cannon, who isWynne-Candy's driver during the Second World War. It is a remarkableperformance by the 20-year-old newcomer, playing three roles;Wendy Hillerwasoriginally cast, but became pregnant, and Powell cast Kerr both because hethought "she would be a star one day," and because he was falling inlove with her. Thefriendship between Clive and Theo is traced for 40 years. They meet again at aGerman prisoner's camp in England, after World War One; Theo ignores Clive andstalks away, but the next day calls to apologize, and is a guest at a dinner ofBritish establishment types at which, gentlemen all, they assure him hishomeland will be rebuilt: "Europe needs a healthy Germany!" When thetwo men meet again, it is after the German has fled his homeland in 1939. In along speech all done in one take, the explains why he has chosen England overhis birthplace. Walbrook's acting here is sublime with its mastery of tone andmood, and this speech, more than any other, explains why Churchill was wrong tooppose the film. Themost poignant passages involve the general growing older. He looks like acaricature to younger officers--with his beefy face, pink complexion, mustache(grown to hide the dueling scar) and raspy voice. But in his heart he is stillyoung, still in love, still idealistic. At the end of the movie he looks at awater pool in the basement of his bombed-out house, and is reminded of a lakeacross which he once pledged love. And he insists to himself that it is thesame lake, and he is the same man. Rarely does a film give us such a nuancedview of the whole span of a man's life. Is is said that the child is father tothe man. "Colonel Blimp" makes poetry out of what the old know but theyoung do not guess: The man contains both the father, and the child.
