It’s symptomatic that the only really memorable scene during “PauloCoelho’s Best Story,” a film with a running time of 112 minutes, lasts about 60seconds and focuses not on the title character, but on his father. Set in a carwhile Pedro Coelho (Diaz) listens to a song co-written by his son Paulo (Andrade)and, realizing he’s the inspiration of its cruel lyrics, fights back the tears,this scene represents a rare moment of sensibility, authenticity and beauty ina movie terribly lacking in inspiration. Advertisement Written (and produced) byCarolina Kotscho, the screenplay tries to tellPaulo Coelho’s trajectory before he became "the only living author more translatedthan Shakespeare"—from a troubled teen and a troubled young adult untilhe graduated to, judging by the film, a problematic old man. Suffering from a problematicrelationship with his supposedly rigid father (and I say "supposedly"because I often found myself agreeing more with him than with his son), Coelho faceddepression, an inferiority complex for feeling ugly and the rejection of hisbooks, before finally becoming the author whose “The Alchemist” would turn intoa worldwide phenomenon by combining self-help and esotericism in a package withimmense commercial appeal regardless of its literary merits. (No, I'm not afan, although I appreciate some passages of “The Pilgrim”.) Employing a non-chronological timeline that clearly seeks to disguisethe lack of structure and the fact that the narrative is constructed throughscenes that invariably invest in some drama or artificial conflict, this is thekind of movie that feels the need to always include a caption indicating the periodin which a scene takes place every time it jumps—even if thecostumes, the art direction and, well, the fact we have been watching the damnthing for an hour already made it pretty clear the decades we are visiting.However, hammering the audience with unnecessary exposition seems to be a hobbyof this movie and, thus, it is no surprise when a character says "Paulo ismy grandson" when addressing ... the boy's parents, who, I suppose,probably are aware of said kinship. Similarly, just in case we hadn’t noticedyoung Coelho’s ugliness complex, we would certainly become aware of it when we see him inviting agirl to dance just to hear the girl's mother say "But precisely theweirdest and ugliest boy in the whole party?", in a very natural reactionif you are a caricature in a film that treats the one-dimensionality of itscharacters as a rule. Interestingly, at other times that deserved at least some explanation, "Paulo Coelho’s Best Story" simply expects us to accept certainincidents without questioning their logic—as in the scene where theprotagonist participates in a children's play when an actorconveniently fails to show up: after throwing himself on the floor, reciting apoem and throwing a candy to the audience, the hero is cheered by the children,who inexplicably start chanting hisname. And, of course, when his musical partnership with Raul Seixas (Ferreira,perfect) is portrayed, both men are seen creating some of their most iconicsongs through dialogue that simply quotes the lyrics without any insight intothe duo’s creative process. Advertisement Moreover, the cinematic treatment of this partnership isabsolutely disgusting: in addition to suggesting Seixas stole the credit of "Gita"(probably their best song), sending Paulo Coelho into a depressive crisis, the movievirtually ignores the protagonist's relationship with drugs (and the fact heintroduced them to his partner), and even presents him as some kind of rockstar, concocting an absurd scene in which he can be seen singing with talentand energy alongside Raul while their were still at the height of success. Thus, it soon becomes clear that the purpose of "Paulo Coelho’s Best Story" is to throw all kinds of humiliation on its hero, so his eventual victory can emerge as a lesson in persistence; andtherefore is not enough that, as a teen, a doctortells him no one will ever want to read his writings: later on, an editor andfriend will practically repeat the statement in order to highlight the irony. The Paulo Coelho portrayed hereis a selfish, reckless, immature, spoiled and deeply boring person. Afterrunning over a young boy while driving recklessly (and protesting for beingpunished by his father for it!), Coelho is basically the same when we meet himat 65, when, irritated by the incessant talk of the driver hired to transporthim, he steals the man’s car, leavinghim in the middle of nowhere and virtually guaranteeing the poor guy will befired. ("Poor man!", a friend laughs after finding out what Coelhodid—in the only semblance of recognition by the narrative that what Paulo didwas reprehensible, since it seems to believe that’s just a manifestation of his"free spirit." )Competent at least in its production design, which does a great job ofrecreating each time period, "PauloCoelho’s Best Story"also impresses with the makeup job that turns JulioAndrade into a clone of the old Paulo Coelho—at least when we see him in thedistance, as the close-ups end up exposing the artificiality of the prosthetics(and of course director     Daniel Augusto    frequently shoots the actor inclose-ups).Suddenly stopping the narrative after almost two hours as if it had gottired of telling that story (and filling the blanks with an end text), themovie shows for its protagonist the same lack of respect exhibited by the caricaturesthat tell him he’ll never be a writer—and simply by opening the story presentinghim as a singer that he never was, the movie practically denies Paulo Coelho therespect of being recognized for his books, as if they were not enough to justifyhonoring him. Even if I don’t enjoy his work, I am fully aware that hissuccess should have yielded at least an acceptable biopic. This is not one. Advertisement
