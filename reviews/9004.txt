"A Wolf at the Door," the first feature by Brazilian filmmaker FernandoCoimbra, is a strange animal: in one moment, it makes us laugh at onecharacter’s despair; one scene later, it provokes horror and makes us cringewhen that same character acts to address the issue that was disturbing him/her.Balancing itself with an enviable self-assurance between drama, comedy,character study, and, in the last ten minutes, suspense, the film sends the audienceout of the theater with a sense of shame for laughing when the narrative wantedus to. Advertisement Written by the director himself, the story begins when Sylvia (Nascimento)goes to the kindergarten that her little daughter (Ribas) attends in order to pickher up and discovers that the girl had already left with a"neighbor". Unable to imagine why someone would kidnap the child, as herparents are not wealthy, the desperate woman tells the police that her husbandmay have a mistress—and soon the man, Bernardo (Cortaz), confirms that he hadmaintained an affair with the young Rosa (Leal). From then on, the detective incharge (Cazarré) interrogates the three of them, gradually uncovering whatreally happened that day. Surprisingly extracting humor out of a incredibly serious and dramaticsituation, the film is especially benefited by the flawless performances ofLeal, Cortaz and Nascimento. While the latter evokes not only concern abouther daughter, but also impatience with her husband during flashbacks in which shebegins to suspect about his affair,Milhem Cortaz, who usually playsthugs/tough guys, turns Bernardo into a pathetic, weak and desperate man,managing to simultaneously makes us laugh at his situation and also understandthe seriousness of what is happening to him. Still, "Wolf at the Door" really belongs toLeandra Leal, who creates acharacter whose transformation over the course of the movie is extremelyimpressive—beginning as a casual flirt and slowly turning into an absoluteobsession while going through restrained passion and a growing feeling offrustration and anger. Never losing sight of Rosa’s emotional and psychologicaltrajectory, the beautiful actress particularly impresses in a scene where she, afterbeing battered by her beloved one, surrenders to tears and to a nervous tremorthat reveals her fear and her pain. Leal has always been a wonderful actress,but here she proves deserving to be on a list of the greatest Brazilianperformers (and I didn’t event mention her work during the final act, duringwhich she makes "Fatal Attraction"’sGlenn Closelook like Amelie Poulain—without ever turning into a caricature). Advertisement Lensed by the always competentLula Carvalhoin a claustrophobic way intight shots that almost always glue us to the faces of the actors, the filmalso uses a sad and somber palette that gradually becomes suffocating.Moreover, the narrative benefits from shots that communicate the atmosphere ofthe story without the need for dialogue. When Bernardo appears on the leftedge of the frame, looking at something out of the shot and seeming to becornered while Rosa watches him from thebottom right, we realize the dynamic between those two individualsunequivocally. Meanwhile,Fernando Coimbrais able to create small cameramovements that manage to expose the little moments of truth under the lieduring the "alternative" (better yet: incomplete) versions of thestories told by each character.Without making any concessions in its final act, which bravely respectsthe inevitable development of its characters’ actions and temperaments, "Wolf atthe Door" is a remarkable film that introduces Fernando Coimbra as a filmmakerto be closely monitored.
