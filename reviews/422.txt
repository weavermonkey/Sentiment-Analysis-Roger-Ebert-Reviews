The title of the newDean Martinpicture is "something big." The titleis in lower-case letters because Dean Martin is always saying"something big" in the movie. If Dean Martin says "something big"once, he says "something big" 20 times. Everybody else pitches in:Brian Keithsays "something big" ninetimes, andBen Johnsonsays it seven times, and at various times itrefers to a Gatling gun, a raid, a kidnapped wife, a fiancee andeverything except the movie, which is something slow, something dumband, in short, everything except something else. Advertisement That isn't to say it's a complete loss. The director isAndrew V. McLaglen, a devotee ofJohn Ford, and he specializes in nice littlevignettes making good use of character actors. So we get to see BenJohnson,Denver Pyle,Harry CareyJr. and a bunch of others, andthat's fun. Something else to consider is the presence of Dean Martin, a littlegray and grizzled but still playing every scene with a glass of whiskyin his hand. I guess people expect that. The big problem with "something big." I guess, is that it doesn't havea single surprise in its whole two hours. We have traveled this dustyroad before, you and I, past these lonesome pines and the bleachedbones over there of the comedy-action-Western. This is the kind ofunserious Western thatFrank Sinatramade toward the end of his moviecareer: a film in which the personality and off-screen persona of thestar is actually thought to be more important than what's going on. Well, stars are made when they find roles they can sink into. And theydon't survive long when they stop caring. I haven't seen a Dean Martinmovie since "How to Save A Marriage and Ruin Your Life" where his talent was really used.A sad example is "Five Card Stud" (1968), a Western that Martin walkedthrough, and that sleepy-eyedRobert Mitchumwalked away with. Mitchumis a consummate movie actor. Martin has apparently decided not to eventry, and so no matter how often he says "something big," theself-hypnosis doesn't work.
