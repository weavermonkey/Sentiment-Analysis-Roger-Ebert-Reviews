There have been any number of cinematic depictions about how we might findourselves living out the last few days before the imminent annihilation of our planet,ranging from the quiet reflection of the Canadian drama "     Last Night    " to the overblownnonsense of the disaster epic "2012" to some simplecanoodling with     Keira Knightley    in the quirky comedy "Seeking a Friend for the End ofthe World".The latest film to present viewers with a look at the final hours of mankind is anAustralian import titled, appropriately enough, "These Final Hours" and while it doeshave a few things of interest going for it, this low-budget effort ends up arriving at itsnecessarily predictable conclusion in too many unnecessarily predictable ways.Advertisement As the film opens, an asteroid has just landed in the North Atlantic andkicked off a firestorm of destruction that has already taken out huge chunks of thecivilized world. In Perth, Australia, the approaching firestorm is set to arrive in about 12hours and the mood of the remaining populace veers between grim resignation (withsuicides aplenty) and a determination to make Earth's remaining moments play outlike a mash-up of "The Road Warrior" and "     The Purge    ." Our anti-hero, James (NathanPhillips), is leaning more towards the latter and after a farewell snog with girlfriend Zoe(Jessica de Gouw), he decides to leave her alone so that he can spend the rest ofhis time at a wild bacchanal thrown by friend Freddy (     Daniel Henshall    ) with his othergirlfriend, Vicky (     Kathryn Beck    ) and not even her revelations that she is pregnant canconvince him to stay. He wants to get messed up because, as he puts it, "I don't want tofeel a thing."James heads off to the party that he has placed above everything else, andafter getting waylaid along the way, he sees a little girl who has been abducted by a couple ofdepraved weirdos for presumably unspeakable reasons. Despite his insistencethat he no longer cares about anything, he rescues the girl, Rose (     Angourie Rice    ), andwhen he is unable to reunite her with her father, he decides to take her along to theparty in the hopes of finding someone there who can take her to be reunited with herfamily. Needless to say, as they go along their trek, the two bear witness to any numberof horrible sights but Rose's optimism and innocence in the face of the oncomingapocalypse (Spoiler Alert!) begins to change his cynical soul. Once they arrive at theparty—an orgy of open sex, prodigious drug and alcohol abuse and bouts of RussianRoulette—he discovers that nihilism may no longer be his thing and tries to get Roseback together with her family and settle his own outstanding emotional debts before it isreally too late.Written and directed byZak Hilditch, "These Final Hours" is more ambitious than itspresumably inexpensive origins might suggest but this is the kind of storyline that hasbeen done dozens of times before and even the better parts of this effort contain morethan a whiff of the familiar. The finale, for example, is presented in a relatively strikingmanner but anyone who has seen the vastly superior apocalyptic drama "     Take Shelter    "will no doubt notice a number of similarities between the two climaxes. Likewise,the relationship between Phillips (whose presence here, following on the heels ofappearances in such films as "     Wolf Creek    ," "Snake on a Plane" and "The ChernobylDiaries," marks him as one of the guys you least want to have with you on a cinematicexcursion of any duration) and Rice doesn't really hit any overtly wrong notes butnevertheless fails to break any new ground either. Even the end-of-the-world blowoutis nowhere as decadent as one might hope—from what we see, it basically feels likeBurning Man sans the morning-after hangovers—and when it does threaten to becometransgressive, as when little Rose is dosed with Ecstasy and begins tripping, it pullsback the reins before things can get too weird.Advertisement "These Final Hours" has a couple of things in its favor.Sarah Snook, who deliveredsuch an amazing performance in the recent sci-fi mind-bender "     Predestination    ," showsup in a brief but frighteningly vivid part as a grief-stricken mother convinced that Rose isactually her late daughter and     Lynette Curran    has an equally strong scene as James'sestranged mother, who plans on riding out the end with some wine and a few jigsawpuzzles. Visually, the film looks far more expensive that it probably was and thereare some admittedly arresting images scattered throughout. However, none of theseelements are enough to make you forget just how profoundly familiar the rest of itis."These Final Hours" is not without merit but if you pick only one Australian-madeapocalyptic road movie to see in 2015, my guess is that you should probably save yourtime and money and just wait a couple of months for "Fury Road" to arrive.
