You’d have to be totally cynical, with a heart of stone andice water in your veins, not to be even the slightest bit charmed by “OneChance.” Yes, it is pure formula–shamelessly feel-good in its sentimentality,even. It’s based on the true story of unlikely opera singer Paul Potts, theschlubby car phone salesman who won the first season of “Britain’s Got Talent”with his powerful rendition of the Puccini aria “Nessun Dorma.” The YouTubeclip of the shy, portly Potts walking on stage for his audition, opening hissnaggletoothed mouth and blowing the judges away with his enormous tenor voice–including the notoriously hard-to-impressSimon Cowell–has more than 128million views. Similar to the superstardom of fellow contestantSusan Boyle,Potts’ allure lies in the gaping disparity between his appearance and hisability. Advertisement But even if you’d never heard the man’s name prior toentering the theater, you’ll know exactly where this movie is headed at theend. It’s a familiar British comedy along the lines of “The Full Monty,” “Billy Elliot”and “Little Voice” with its working-class setting, eccentric supportingcharacters, dryly self-deprecating humor and ultimately uplifting conclusion. And yet…and yet. This workmanlike underdog tale from directorDavid Frankel(operatingmore in “Marley & Me” mode than “The Devil Wears Prada”) is winningnonetheless, mostly thanks to an irresistible lead performance from JamesCorden. You may have seen Corden in his scene-stealing supporting turn as KeiraKnightley’s busker buddy in “Begin Again,” or perhaps you’ve heard recentlythat Corden will be taking over forCraig Fergusonas host of “The Late LateShow” on CBS. “One Chance” is a great showcase for his likable persona; withhis understated, guileless presence, he makes potentially maudlin material godown easy. Not that this is a spoiler, mind you; the script from JustinZackman (whose previous work includes last year’s broadly wacky “The BigWedding”) spells things out early and often. “As long as I can remember, I’ve wantedto sing,” Corden-as-Potts says in voiceover at the film’s start. “I mean,really sing.” As a kid, Potts was bullied routinely in his Welsh smalltown for his awkwardness and his sophisticated musical tastes. (There’s arunning bit about the fact that his name sounds similar to that of formerCambodian dictator Pol Pot.) As an adult living at home with his parents–thesweetly supportiveJulie Waltersand the gruffly disapprovingColm Meaney–hestill gets bullied by the same dudes. His one friend is his boss at CarphoneWarehouse: the odd-looking and thoroughly inappropriate Braddon (MackenzieCrook). But it’s through Braddon’s prodding that Potts summons thecourage to pursue a romance with a woman he’d been flirting with online: Julz(the immensely appealingAlexandra Roach), a shy but clearly decent-hearteddrug-store cashier who becomes his wife. Their imperfect first date is kind ofadorable, as is the no-nonsense way they stick by each other through variousups and downs. Potts suffers a number of failures and embarrassmentsthroughout the years leading up to his big breakthrough, including aless-than-stellar performance before his idol,Luciano Pavarotti. “One Chance”(which is also the name of Potts’ debut album) is actually more about the upsand downs he endured prior to the 2007 “Britain’s Got Talent” audition, withthe tryout itself serving as an inevitable endnote – just something he signedup for on a lark because he and Julz were in need of money.  (While Corden is a singer himself, Potts' vocals are dubbed throughout convincingly.) About that tryout: Frankel stages a detailed recreation ofit, down to the interview clips with Potts that aired beforehand, and intercutsthem with real-life footage of the judges and audience members reacting withapplause and awe. Whether you’ve never seen it before or you’ve seen it amillion times, the goose bumps are undeniable. You may as well just give in. Advertisement
