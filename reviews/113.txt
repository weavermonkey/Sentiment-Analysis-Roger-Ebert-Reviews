"Closely Watched Trains" is a quiet, charming, very,human film. It comes from Czechoslovakia and isn'tpushy like those big American movies; it will notforce its point of view on you, or sweep you up in atide of emotion. Indeed, if you're charged upemotionally, you'd better lie down for an hour or twobefore going to see it. It requires an audience atpeace with itself. The story has to do with a young apprenticerailroader (Vaclac Neckar) who fails to make love witha sweet young conductress (Jitka Bendova). Fearing heisn't adequate as a man, he tries unsuccessfully tocommit suicide. Advertisement Then a friendly doctor (played byJiri Menzel, thedirector) suggests that the unhappy youth distracthimself while making love (say, think of a soccergame) or find a more experienced woman. When thestationmaster refuses to volunteer his wife, youngtrainee Milos bravely seeks other candidates andfinally succeeds with a resistance fighter namedVictoria. Relieved and happy to discover that he is indeed aman, the youth blows up a Nazi ammunition train andbecomes a hero. End of movie. But the plot (as isusually the case with good movies) has very little todo with what the movie is about, and hardly anythingto do with the effect it will have upon you. This is a movie about innocence. There are worldlypeople in it (including the train dispatcher, whodelights in rubber stamping his female conquests). Butthey are all seen through the wide, sincere eyes ofyoung Milos. He is no Prince Hamlet, nor was he meantto be; his grandfather was crushed to death whiletrying to hypnotize the German army into retreating,and his father retired at the age of 46 and sleeps onthe sofa all day. Milos happily takes the trainman'sÂ job, since all he will have to do is stand on theplatform and kill time. He is unheroic, naive and not very bright. But thesaving force of love reshapes his destiny, as theysay.
