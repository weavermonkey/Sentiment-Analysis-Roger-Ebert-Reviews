Awww. Their best friends are killed in an auto accident, leaving behind their cute little 1-year-old daughter, Sophie. Holly Berenson and Eric Messer are appointed in the will as Sophie's joint custodians. Alas, Holly and Eric (     Katherine Heigl    and     Josh Duhamel    ) can't stand each other. But the will specifies they should move into their friends' home, so Sophie won't miss her own room.Awww. Sophie is just as cute as most 1-year-old babies. She's always ready to roll, maybe because she's got backup; the character is played by triplets (Alexis, Brynn and Brooke Clagett). Holly and Eric know nothing 'bout raisin' no babies. The first emergency comes when Sophie does do-do in her diaper. Advertisement Awww. This is really sad. Holly and Eric have to share the same enormous Atlanta mansion. I think it has room for an indoor 100-yard dash. Although their deceased friends Peter and Alison (Hayes MacArthurandChristina Hendricks) were young, they must have been loaded. "The mortgage is pre-paid for a year," the lawyer tells Holly and Eric. How many people can say that? Awww, this is never gonna work out. Eric is a tomcat on the prowl. Hell, that first night he met Holly on a blind date set up by Peter and Alison, he had another date lined up for later. And Holly â€” well, she's one of your organized types, spic and span, not a mess like Messer. Plus, she maybe has a crush on Sam (Josh Lucas), the handsome pediatrician. So anyway, what happens in "Life As We Know It"? You'll never guess in a million years. Never. You might just as well give up right now. I don't like spoilers, so just let me say that Holly and Sam adopt Sophie and live happily ever after in the mansion. Awww.
