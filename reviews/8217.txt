The film omits several crucial scenes from the novel in which we see Ender grow as both a military cadet and a social animal. It also flubs a couple of pivotal moments that show Ender passing or failing major tests of character.Â For starters, Ender's supposed to be a target when he enters Battle School, the outer space boot camp where kids learn how to lead, follow and plan. On the way there, Graff singles Ender out as the brightest of the new recruits. "You made them hate me," Ender says to Graff. He's right, but wouldn't know it based on the way Ender instantly connects with the characters who will become his friends. He meets Bean (Aramis Knight) right before Graff embarrasses him, and befriends Petra (Hailee Steinfield) right after Bonzo (Moises Arias), a senior-ranking recruit, bullies him. Advertisement
