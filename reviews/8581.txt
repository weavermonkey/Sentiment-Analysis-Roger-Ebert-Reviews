In 2012,political commentator, author, disgraced former university president andconvicted felonDinesh D'Souzareleased "2016: Obama's America," adocumentary that purported to investigate our president's past in order touncover his hidden agenda that, left unchecked, could very well lead ourcountry to the brink of destruction. Although the film was mocked by many ofthose who bothered to review it (it did not receive advance critics screenings,meaning that there were few reviews when it opened and that supporters couldthen claim that it was being ignored by the lamestream media) and most ofD'Souza's findings and conclusions were widely discredited by scholars, journalistsand others with a weird reliance on things like facts, the film became a hitamongst conservative audiences and would pull in $33 million dollars at the boxoffice, making it number 2 on the list of top-grossing political documentaries,just missing out on beating "Fahrenheit 9/11" by only $86 million. Advertisement D'Souzahas returned with "America," a movie that arrives on the heels of anad campaign that suggests that it will be a bit of speculative fictionexamining what the world might be like if George Washington had been felled bya British bullet during the Battle of Brandywine (on September 11, 1777, forthose of you playing at home) and, as a result, the Revolutionary War had beenlost and the United States of America had never existed. However, anyoneturning up at the multiplex in order to see what promises at first to be ablend of "It's a Wonderful Life," the immortal anti-Communist short"Red Nightmare" and an evening of the History Channel will beoutraged to discover that, following a brief prologue, the film completelyabandons that promised conceit and never returns to it. If it is any comfort tothose viewers, it is that they will soon be sharing their outrage with anyonewho turned up in the hope of witnessing cohesive thinking or rudimentaryfilmmaking skills. Havingseen all of his dire predictions about the direction of our country underObama's lead in "2016: Obama's America" come true—his perspective, not history's—D'Souza finds himself pondering the state of his adoptedcountry and wondering why so many people want to destroy it by undoingeverything that made it great in order to remake it into some kind of socialistnightmare. Furthermore, he wants to get to the bottom of the notions thatmonsters like Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn,Michael Mooreand other members of theradical cabal use as a basis for their alleged hatred of America—that we stole the land from the Indians and committed genocideagainst them to boot, that we seized a huge chunk of Mexico as well, that weare trying to dominate the world and as much of its resources as possible, thatthere is a staggering amount of income inequality that unfairly leaves the vastmajority of our wealth in the hands of a few people and, of course, slavery. Inan unexpected twist, D'Souza amazingly manages to refute all of those claims tothe satisfaction of his target audience. Most ofhis theories and suppositions are misleading at best (he makes a point ofmentioning that Obama supported the bank bailouts but fails to mention whosepresidency they occurred under) and silly at worst (such as his assertion thatthe real face of income inequality is none other thanMatt Damonsince he madea lot of money from those Jason Bourne films) and will presumably be pickedapart in the coming weeks but in order to save time and energy all around, Iwill not criticize it on those grounds, except to wonder why he left the recountingof the Texas-Mexico conflict to Canadian-born Ted Cruz. My job is to analyzehow the film works in cinematic terms and on that basis, D'Souza andco-directorJohn Sullivan(who also directed the other big conservative-leaningdocumentary "Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed") have failedmiserably. It looks terrible, it plods along with all the verve of a PowerPointpresentation, the occasional dramatic recreations are exceptionally cheesy andthe interview footage is so needlessly over-edited that you get the feelingthat something may have gotten changed around in the cutting room. Advertisement Now I amnot claiming that they have fudged some of the conversations, only that theyhave presented them in a way that makes them look as if they were fudged. Saywhat you will about Michael Moore—at least he makes his filmslook slick and professional even while occasionally bending the narrative asneeded (which is one of the reasons that they stir up so much controversy)instead of like a junior college multi-media project that was returned with"See Me" written in the corner. For that matter, Moore is also anentertaining screen presence as well, which is more than can be said forD'Souza. He has precious little screen presence, his interview style veers betweenthe fawning to the absurdly combative and he practically oozes untrustworthinessto such a degree that he winds up undercutting whatever arguments he might havelegitimately made. The onlytime that "America" comes alive is in the final section when, havingundercut any reason for good, God-fearing people to hate America, the film setsout to identify the people who are trying to ruin everything in order to pushtheir devious agenda. As it turns out, the architect behind all this is SaulAlinsky, who used the lessons in organization that he learned from famedgangster Frank Nitti to pull together hippies and community organizers togetherto push things forth. Although Obama is deemed Alinsky's most famous disciple,he is no longer running for office so obviously a new target must be found. Ina stunning development, that target turns out to be none other than HillaryClinton, who uses her power to steer Alinsky into new and dangerous directions.This means that we get to see amusingly staged dramatic recreations in whichHillary, "under the spell of a Methodist minister," meets in back roomswith Alinsky, who is made up to look like the creepy stranger offering kidscandy and a ride in his van in an old Sid Davis social hygiene short, to gether marching orders. Thanks to their efforts, we now live in a land in which welearn that even an ordinary guy can somehow commit three felonies a day just bydoing his own thing. Ofcourse, this is the part where D'Souza finally mentions his own recentconviction after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, leading to ashot of him sitting handcuffed in a cell—presumably to show thesacrifice that he has made for telling the truth in his last film—that will inspire murmurs of outrage from some and outrightgiggles from others. Yes, this section is inadvertently hilarious andoverwrought but at least it’s presented with an energythat the film otherwise lacks. Other than that, "America" is like thecinematic equivalent of one of those forwarded e-mails of mostly discredited"facts" that you receive from an uncle and at least those sometimesinclude family photos or a meat loaf recipe that can be of some value.Advertisement
