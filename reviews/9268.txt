The lastcouple of weeks in August are typically a rough road for movie fans as thestudios use the time to dump the cinematic dregs that they figured were tooweak to survive during either the summer box-office derby or the equallycompetitive fall awards season during a period when they might conceivably makea few bucks off of audiences willing tosit through anything new at the multiplex. Trust me, films don't get muchdreggier than "No Escape," a dreadful and creepily exploitativewould-be thriller, low-grade trash that it is too silly and stupid to be as offensive as itfrequently comes close to being throughout. AdvertisementOwen Wilsonplays Jack Dwyer, adown-on-his-luck businessman who hopes to reverse his sagging fortunes bypacking up his entire family—ridiculously patient wife Annie (Lake Bell) andadorable moppet daughters Lucy and Beaze (Sterling Jerinsand Clare Geare)—towork in the clean water program of some massive American conglomerate in theiroutpost in an unnamed Asian city. (Although never identified by name, the filmwas shot in Thailand, a fact that probably will not be stressed too heavily intheir Chamber of Commerce videos, though it will probably get heavy play in theones produced by neighboring countries.) The family has hardly landed in theirhotel room when things start to go sideways—the television, phone and internetare out and when Jack ventures out the next morning in search of a newspaper,he winds up in the middle of a brutal street clash between police andprotesters before barely making it back to the hotel. As itturns out, revolutionaries angered over the recent American takeover of theirwater plant have murdered the corrupt prime minister, overthrown thegovernment and are now hell-bent on finding and murdering any and allforeigners stranded in the chaos. The Dwyers manage to make it to the roof oftheir hotel—a favorite of visiting Americans—but they are strafed by gunfirefrom a helicopter and are forced to make their escape by leaping to the roof ofthe building next door. Now, stuck in a country where they don't speak the language and wherenearly everyone wants to kill them on sight, the Dwyers struggle to stay aliveuntil they can figure out a way to get out of the country. Helping them fromtime to time is Hammond (Pierce Brosnan), a mysterious Brit who always managesto turn up just when the script requires an improbable rescue. With itsclunky filmmaking, overt sadism (with the expected shootings, slashings andburnings augmented by an attempted rape and a little girl being forced atgunpoint to shoot her own father) and borderline xenophobia, one might assumethat "No Escape" was the latest film fromEli Roth. In fact, it isthe brainchild of fraternal filmmakers John Erick andDrew Dowdle, whose pastcollaborations, including the American version of "Quarantine,""Devil" and "As Above, So Below," have told stories aboutordinary dopes struggling to escape from a confined space while being menacedby some terrifying menace or another. "No Escape" may shift theirgenre focus from horror to action and the size of the confined space may haveexpanded but other than that, the film (which John directed and Drew producedwith the two collaborating on the screenplay) is basically the same. As hasbeen the case with their previous efforts, the results this time around arepretty dire—the screenplay is bad boilerplate with the occasional lapse intooutright buffoonery (I have seen comedies that have not inspired the kind oflaughs that resulted at the screening I attended when Jack asks his wife"You okay" after a particularly hair-raising moment), the characterswe are meant to be rooting for are bores and the action is never especiallyexciting—but the way in which it treats its ostensibly serious subject in sucha flip and exploitative manner is far more offensive than anything they haveoffered up before. Advertisement Even if you can work your way around thepotentially distasteful notion of examining the problems of the Third Worldthrough the eyes of accidentally inconvenienced First Worlders, you still haveto deal with the fact that the film is so uncommitted to its ostensible causethat it not only neglects to identify the country in which it is set,presumably so as not to offend any potential ticket-selling market, but refusesto give any voice (other than "Kill Kill") to the those doing therevolting, preferring to see them as nothing more than faceless hordeshell-bent on slaughtering anyone who comes across their path. Then again, it isperhaps just as well that the screenplay eschews the political aspects for themost part because the one scene in which they come to the forefront—in whichthe Pierce Brosnan character relates the evils of American companies who comein and seize Third World industries in order to maximize profits—is anabsolute embarrassment that drags the already poky proceeding to a dead haltfrom which it never recovers. Dramaticallyinert, unintentionally funny (especially during the largely incompetent usageof slow-motion photography that borders on parody at times) and almostpornographically violent at time, "No Escape" is an ugly, ugly filmfrom which no one emerges completely unscathed. For Wilson, this is a strangethrowback to the days in which he was shoehorned into genre films(such as "Anaconda," "The Haunting" and "Behind EnemyLines") that were uncomfortable fits for his laconic charms and forBrosnan, this is the latest in a depressingly long string of films in which heis far superior to the material that he has been given to work with. Why theywould choose to appear in something so pandering, mean-spirited andmanipulative is beyond my ability to compute but for whatever reason, the endresult is that they have landed in one of the most unpleasant films ofthe year.
